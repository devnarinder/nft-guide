# Developing NFT Smart Contracts

NFT smart contracts are self-executing code on a blockchain that define the rules and ownership of non-fungible tokens. Understanding how to develop these contracts is essential for creating custom NFTs and decentralized applications.

## NFT Standards

- **ERC-721:** The original Ethereum NFT standard enabling unique tokens with ownership tracking.  
- **ERC-1155:** A multi-token standard that supports both fungible and non-fungible tokens, optimizing gas and batch transfers.

## Basic Structure of an NFT Smart Contract

- **Metadata:** Defines the NFT’s name, description, and media URI.  
- **Minting function:** Allows creation of new tokens, usually restricted to the contract owner or authorized minters.  
- **Ownership management:** Tracks token owners and supports transfer functions.  
- **Events:** Logs important actions like transfers and approvals for blockchain transparency.

## Tools & Frameworks for NFT Development

- **Solidity:** Primary programming language for Ethereum smart contracts.  
- **OpenZeppelin:** Industry-standard library providing secure, audited implementations of NFT standards.  
- **Hardhat / Truffle:** Development frameworks for compiling, testing, and deploying contracts.  
- **IPFS / Arweave:** Decentralized storage solutions to host NFT metadata and media files.

## Best Practices

- Use audited libraries like OpenZeppelin to avoid security vulnerabilities.  
- Keep metadata on decentralized storage to ensure permanence.  
- Implement royalty standards like EIP-2981 for creator compensation.
