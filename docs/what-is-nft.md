# What is an NFT?

**Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)** are unique digital assets secured on a blockchain that represent ownership of a specific item or piece of content. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, NFTs are **non-interchangeable**, meaning each token has distinct value and properties.

## Key Features of NFTs

- **Uniqueness:** Each NFT has a unique identifier that makes it different from any other token.
- **Indivisibility:** NFTs cannot be divided into smaller units; they exist as whole tokens only.
- **Proof of Ownership:** NFTs provide verifiable proof of ownership recorded on an immutable blockchain ledger.
- **Interoperability:** NFTs can be traded or used across different decentralized applications (dApps) and marketplaces.

## Use Cases of NFTs

- Digital art and collectibles  
- Virtual real estate  
- Gaming assets  
- Music and media rights  
- Identity and credentials

## Why NFTs Matter

NFTs enable creators and owners to **monetize digital content** with provable scarcity and provenance. They are revolutionizing how value is exchanged online by introducing true ownership and liquidity to digital assets.
